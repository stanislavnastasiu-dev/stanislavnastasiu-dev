- 👋 Hi, I’m @stanislavnastasiu
- 👀 I’m passionate about exploring and learning new technologies.
- 😔 Learning React was a rabbit hole I wish I avoided—there’s always a new “blazing-fast” framework waiting around the corner.
- 🌵 Currently diving into Android development with Kotlin & Compose 💀
- 😑 Born to code in Scratch, now mastering C# with .NET 4.8.
- 🛠️ Working with Angular & Ionic for web and mobile magic.
- 🐳 Recently developed a fondness for Docker and containerization.
